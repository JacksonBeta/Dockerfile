Commit the new file
It looks like your GitHub repository is missing the proper folder structure. Let me guide you through correcting this:

Make sure you have:

A client folder with all frontend files
A server folder with all backend files
A shared folder with schema.ts
If these folders don't exist in your GitHub repository, you'll need to create them and move the relevant files into them.

Would you like me to help you organize your files into the correct structure? I can explain exactly which files need to go in which folders.

Adding a README file is a good practice for your GitHub repository but it's not strictly required for deployment. A README helps others understand your project, how to set it up, and how to use it.

If you'd like to add one, here's how:

In your GitHub repository, click "Add file" > "Create new file"
Name it "README.md" (exactly like that, with uppercase README)
Add content like this:
# Hollywood Weekly Distribution Platform
